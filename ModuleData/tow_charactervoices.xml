    Character name maps to an NPCCharacter id. For example, in tow_troopdefinitions_vc.xml, Animated Skeleton
    has the id "tow_skeleton_recruit". To assign it a voice, find the appropriate voice_definition (or create one).
    Once you have a desired voice_definition, set the voice attribute equal to the desired voice_definition's 
    sound_and_collision_info_class. For example, if you want Animated Skeleton's to be assigned a voice from the
    "skeleton" class of voice definitions, you should create the following entry:
    
    <Character name="tow_skeleton_recruit" voice="skeleton" />
    
    Once this is done, Animated Skeleton agents will be randomly given a voice_definition from the set of all
    voice_definitions with the sound_and_collision_info_class="skeleton".
