She and her family proudly owned most of Averland, someday she hopes that she will get Averland.

Clothilde herself is a beautiful and kind woman, looking after the destitute of Averland, she is one of the least capable of holding a military, but it doesn’t stop her from protecting Alptraum land." />

Younger than Alberich by a couple of years, Rudolf is the parallel to Alberich, while his father taught Alberich in courtship and governing, he taught Rudolf the art of war and how to kill a man as quickly as possible (as well as making sure that same man will stay dead). While it may seem like being a proper lord should come natural to him, it is the exact opposite, as he has a constant feeling to protect his brother in both war and in the court, yelling at and threatening whoever tries to oppose Alberich and his rule.

Anton himself is the furthest from Sylvania, meaning that he (for the most part) is the least interested in warfare and participates more in diplomacy and trade with Stirland’s neighbours, Averland, Talabecland, Wissenland, and Reikland. He is obsessed with first impressions, and loves to eat the finest cheeses from time to time. " />

While she is interested in trade herself, she doesn’t trade nearly as much as Anton, as she balances her life as a governor and as a war general quite well.

Treitschke was one of the lords who wanted to assume power as Elector count after Alberich's succession, but after seeing Alberich in action, he decided to act more passively in the court. Artur himself can’t help but be invested in political intrigue, constantly looking for rumours and enjoying himself by spectating the bickerings of the Leitdorfs and Alptraums down south. Artur himself is a very curious and happy old man, lending an ear to whatever gossip one may have." />

Krebs is a man of the past, and as a man of the past, he often misunderstands the threats facing Stirland in the present. In the past he has refused to hear the tidings from the east, that the dead walk and darkness gathers. He is far more interested in the economic gains of his holding, and the projections of his tax revenue within the next five years, assuming stirland does not march to war. . Immanuel is a very bland and boring man, he often follows the most charismatic members of the court, such as Erich von Halstedt, and loves to bicker amongst other lords over the most pointless of things.

Erich is one of the major participants in Stirland politics, constantly trying to go against Alberich from his position from Elector count. He does this by besmirching their name and honour, often hiring cries to blame Alberich personally for crop harvests and levee failures, as well as downright insulting the Haupt-Andersens to other members of the court. However, after a few “polite and discreet” death threats from Rudolf and his men, Halstedt stopped trying to become Elector, instead trying his hardest to work with the court to keep Stirland a better place while staying in line with his own political agenda. Erich is an insufferable and conceited individual, constantly believing that he is the proper ruler of Stirland and would solve the economical crisis “in but a year”" />

During his lifetime, Petr has faced swathes of undead in almost a constant barrage, and while he is able to ward them back with the help of the Church of Sigmar and his allies, he is afraid that the Von Carsteins have interest in his land, and will soon take it with zero effort. Due to this, Petr constantly tries to tell the Stirlander court to preemptively invade Sylvania or to prepare defences. These warnings often fall on deaf ears, or are considered too costly at the present moment to consider. " />

Once a youthful and fiery man, he is now bordering on geriatric. He loses attention in conversations quite commonly and is prone to fits of confusion. Both his knightly service and his venerable age has taken a toll on his body, such that he struggles to continue his marital duties, though he stubbornly persists.  It is rumoured that Lord Voss still insists on being the grandmaster of the Knights Raven as he is afraid of his Lieutenant, Sir Rolph Van Loenen, is still too choleric and inexperienced to be ready for such a position. Siegfriedhof is in need of an equally wise and strong ruler; for now that ruler will be Lord Voss. " />
  <Hero id="tor_emp_lord_stirland_second_3" is_noble="true" faction="Faction.stirland_clan_2" text="Sir Rolph Van Loenen is a rash and ambitious lieutenant of the Knights Raven. He is the sole reason as to why Lord Voss has yet to step down from his position of Grandmaster.  While he shows great fervour and excitement on the field, the young man is a horrible tactician and is easily enraged at the most minor slight. Sir Rolph is a skillful warrior and holds the esteem of his fellows, but there is more to leadership than the sword and as said before he lacks vital qualities. " />

Darius knows much about the Vampires and their evil ways, and while he is not one for combat, he goes to great lengths to aid Lord Voss in protecting Siegfriedhof and often provides advice on hunting, religious matters and defence. Darius himself is a very suspicious man that often feeds  the paranoia and suspicion of the citizens of Siegfriedhof. For as long as anyone can remember he has been plagued with fits where he will  shout about the arrival of “Them” and how “They have multiple ears!” In the worst cases he will use his authority to  put the militia and knights of Siegfriedhof on high alert over mere shadows and he will chase down even the smallest mouse, smashing both the mouse and anything in his way to it. While many people have their own thoughts on what “They” may be, Sigmar knows that only Darius knows what they truly are. " />

While she also trades with the Moot, the issues regarding Stirlands Sylvanian neighbours take precedence, and she works closely with Lord Voss and Petr Von Stolpe. Alexandra von Munsterburg is a constantly tired woman, and even though she is of quite young age, she can’t help but feel exhausted and disgruntled from the most little of activity, this does not stop her from fighting though. She is a zealous woman, and takes pride in her efforts to aid the preservation of the nearby Skaranorak Temples." />

Andreas deals with the Moot begrudgingly, as he sees the region as rightful Stirlander territory. Despite this, he can’t help but feel a sense of protection over the Halflings.  He puts in an effort to treat the Halflings within his lands with proper care, something that can not be said for other Stirlander lords. Andreas is a very honourable and just man; he typically reciprocates kindness with kindness, and has no hesitation to return a slight with one of his own, as a result he is either loved or hated by many of his peers.

Marobaude himself is a barrel chested and powerful man, one who prides himself in his martial skill and will spill his last drops of blood in order to protect the Sigmar-blessed pillar of stone that is guarded within the temple. Sadly, Marobaude tends to believe in Sigmar above all else, especially when it comes to politics. Whenever Southern Stirland faces political issues, Marobaude waives it and believes that “Sigmar will solve your petty matters”, which of course leads to said issues being unsolved due to Marobaude’s unwavering faith in Sigmar.

  <Hero id="tor_emp_lord_wissenland_factionleader" is_noble="true" faction="Faction.wissenland_clan_1" text="Emmanuelle von Liebwitz is somewhat of a mystery. She is certainly the most eligible maiden in the Empire; and yet she remains unmarried. She’s widely regarded as a horrible governor; and yet Nuln and Wissenland have risen to the pinnacle of power under her rule. She always seems more concerned with the next ball or masquerade; and yet her cunning political machine is always one step ahead of her enemies. Emmanuelle is either the luckiest woman to have ever ruled over Nuln, or she is far smarter than her critics give her credit for. The people of Nuln love her and are completely loyal to her rule. The people of wider Wissenland tolerate her but greatly enjoy the increased autonomy brought by her indifference." />

To most, Leos is cold and aloof. He attends social functions not because he seems to enjoy them, but because it is my duty to attend.’ He is polite in conversation, but not sociable. The Liebwitz have just recently gotten past a scandal involving him; rumors concerning his sexuality and his nearly obsessive devotion to his sister were widespread all over Wissenland, at least until those who perpetrated the rumors began receiving visits from the watch." />

He is the lord of Grissenwald, Kreutzhofen, Weilerberg and Serrig, but spends most of his time near Grissenwald, patrolling the southern extent of the Reikwald. He is well liked by his people and is known for coming to their defense when called. Should Wissenland assemble for war, he is a likely candidate for Lord of the collected vassals’ forces." />
  <Hero id="tor_emp_lord_wissenland_first_4" is_noble="true" faction="Faction.wissenland_clan_1" text="Elspeth von Draken has been an institution in Nuln for three generations. Her desolate black tower stands at the edge of the Gardens of Morr on the outskirts of Nuln for as long as anyone can remember. Children's stories of the ‘Graveyard Rose’ are used by parents to terrify their children into staying in bed lest ‘the dark lady snatch them up!’ Occasionally an over zealous witch hunter will attempt to breach her fastness in order to confirm her suspected corruption. If the political machine of the Elector-Countess doesn’t stop them, the hunter will often enter the Garden of Morr and never be seen again. Rumors abound that even the Supreme Patriarch of the Colleges of Magic suspects her loyalties, and attempts to keep an eye on her. Despite all of this, the people of Nuln know she is their dark lady. Whatever else she might be, von Draken is loyal to Nuln and to the Countess, and for the average Wissenlander that is more than enough. " />

Molly Toppenheimer is not impatient, even if Emmanuelle did not have the open desire to split Nuln away from Wissenland, without any children and thanks to the large amounts of authority given to Molly by Emmanuelle, it is only a matter of time until a Toppenheimer is a Elector-Count, either of all of Wissenland and Nuln, or just of Wissenland.

A vampire sprung from the most infamous of lineages, Mannfred was ever a schemer and a manipulator. During the Vampire Wars, when the great Vlad von Carstein made his attempt to seize control of the Empire, Mannfred remained in the shadows, manipulating his peers through sorcery and deceit. Mannfred lacks the vision and true genius of Vladimir. It is perhaps the only thing he lacks. Mannfred is exceptionally cunning and devious, more than any other. He was both willing and able to defeat his sire by betraying him to the enemy. He played a similar part in the defeat of Konrad, whilst also avoiding his brother-in-darkness’s brutal rule. After Konrad fell Mannfred returned to his ancestral home, to make his bid for the Empire of Sigmar as his predecessors before. At the Battle of Hel Fenn, he was slain in battle, his corpse sinking beneath the mire. After nearly four hundred years, he has returned to blight the Old World once again.

Many Vampires would vye for the title of Count, locked in brutal in-fighting amidst their own kind for many long years as their ancestral homeland was slowly annexed by the Empire. Greatest among these contenders was Dietrich von Dohl, known as the Crimson Lord of Sylvania and master of Castle Senkhof. A patient and methodical beast, von Dohl sought complete control over his peers by any brutal means necessary. When Mannfred returned from his watery grave, he found a fractured court of bloodthirsty contenders awaiting him. Though Mannfred von Carstein has once more wrested control over Sylvania, he is not without rivals, and Von Dohl is greatest of them all." />

She was slain by the Dwarfs of Zhufbar for carrying one of the ancient grimoires of Nehkhara and their ancient grudge against her cousin. Though the siege cost them dearly, for many thousands of clansman now rotted in the earth, the Dwarfs stormed the castle and murdered the Countess in her own coffin before affixing her burned remains in a warded tomb. Over the recent decades, the warding runes have gone missing, Emmanuelle’s spirit no longer silent as she seeks her vengeance on the living and slowly returns to her full form." />

Once a Sister of Shallya, Elize had served as loyal handmaiden to Countess Isabella von Carstein. It was Elize at her side when her mistress passed away from the wasting illness, and it was she who witnessed Vlad return his wife from Morr’s clutches. Poor, gentle Elize was Isabella’s fist meal upon awakening, and she continued to serve as the countess’ loyal handmaiden until her untimely end. In the centuries that followed, Elise became one of the most politically powerful members of her bloodline. She did not fear Mannfred’s wrath any more than Isabella's incandescent and unpredictable tantrums, or Vlad's quietly menacing disappointment. She knew which strands to pluck to see her safely out of the von Carstein web, and which to pull in order to get back in, should it be necessary." />

Though his father and all his court of ghouls were slain, Erikan was saved and spirited away to Sylania, where he would become the blood-son and champion of Madame Elize. Though loathed by his own kind, Erikan has served faithful as one of the Drakenhof Templars. When offered by Madame Elize the chance to take the name of von Carstein, he refused, unwilling to reject his heritage. Since then, he has lost much favor in the court of Drakenhof Castle, a pariah with no true allies." />

Though the history of his siring and unlife are left a mystery to most, it is well known that Markos remains a dangerous threat and never to be taken lightly. Like his cousin, Mannfred, Markos chose to travel and learn from the world. He went east, studying blade and sorcery to bolster his own vampiric powers. Since his return, he has remained a quiet and patient creature, waiting for the moment that he might seize power in the courts of Drakenhof." />

Instead, he met his end at the hands of Gotrek Gurnisson and Felix Jaeger. When Mannfred returned to Castle Drakenhof, he raised Krieger back into unlife, though perhaps more to make a mockery of the one who believed he was fated to rule the Kingdom of the Night." />

Rumors and gossip have suggested the Countess Bundebad secretly aided the Stirlander exiles in escaping and even organizing a mercenary company to fight for them.

It wasn’t much of an improvement and nothing near what he felt he deserved. When the Vampires returned, he saw an opportunity for something better than a life of taxing peasants for turnips and complaining about the quality of wine. He was the first to betray his fellows, corrupting some of his fellow exiled nobles and selling the others to the von Carsteins in return for a better future as one of them. Von Bitte is everything the Empire’s nobility represents, spoiled and amplified by his new unlife as a Vampire. He is the brutal kind to kill for even the slightest offence or even for the sheer pleasure, revelling in his new power. Through sheer ruthlessness, he was given leadership over the newly sired Vampires, more of a nominal title as von Bitte couldn’t care less about keeping his new kin in check." />

Though they held out for many weeks, the Ranger Scouts were abandoned and surrounded by the creatures of the night.

A distant relation to the legendary Walach Harkon, Gogivich is a bloodthirsty monster that cares only for the thrill of battle and slaughter. From Karkvald Castle, his Knights of Red Death make their home, parroting a cruel bastardisation of knightly valour. Though he has little love for the Prince of Sylvania, Gorgivich remains loyal to Mannfred as oath-bound honour demands. Of course, this is also appeased by the promise of bloodshed, an easy payment for the blade of one so skilled in carnage as Krakvald." />
